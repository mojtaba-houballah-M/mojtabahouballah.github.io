I am a postdoctoral researcher working on agroecosystem and forest ecosystem modelling,
with a focus on carbon dynamics, land surface models (ORCHIDEE–STICS),
and multicriteria and viability-based approaches.

My research addresses ecosystem responses to disturbances,
management strategies, and long-term sustainability.
